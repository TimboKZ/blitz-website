* Added config property validation. Blitz will now check the config for required properties and add them using default values if said properties are missing, or throw an error if the type of the property is invalid.
* Made `content` for pages optional. If `content` is empty, Blitz is just going to render the file specified in `template` as if the `content` pointed to an empty file. Keep in mind, since `uri` is also optional you can now create pages using only 1 line, like so:
    ```yaml
    # In the config:
    pages:
      - template: 'index.pug'
      - template: 'help.pug'
    ```
