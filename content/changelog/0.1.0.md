version: '0.1.0'
---
* Added `hash` to Pug locals available on every page. It's generated randomly every time `blitz build` is run, and can
be used to bypass browser's cache, like so:

    ```jade
    link(rel='stylesheet', href=asset('style.css?' + hash))
    //- Will force browser to ignore cache and download the file again, result: 
    //- <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style.css?kNP2xjPl5Atk">
    ```

* Added `url()` function to Pug locals. If called with no arguments, it returns the URL of the current page. Accepts
page ID as the only argument, more about it below.
* Added `index` page ID by default, available via `url('index')` in Pug. It points to the website root directory if
 `explicit_html_extensions` is set to false or to root `index.html` file otherwise. It's useful for Home/Index links.
Keep in mind that index is produced regardless of whether the index page exists or not. **This ID can be overwritten
from the config.**
* Added page IDs to the config and the `url()` function to Pug locals. Now, you can specify an ID for a page and then
reference it in your templates using `url(<id>)`. Consider the example below:

    ```yaml
    # In the config:
    pages:
      # ...
      - uri: '/docs'
        id: 'docs'
        # ...
    ```
    
    ```jade
    //- Somewhere in your Pug template:
    a(href=url(docs))= Link to documentation
    ```
    
* Made the `template` property of directories specified in `child_directories` optional. If it is not present, no files
will be generated. This is useful if you just want to pass the content from all files in a directory without actually
creating the pages.
