## Blitz config

> If you're looking for an example Blitz config (i.e. `blitz.yml`), scroll to the very bottom of this page.

This section will look at the structure of `blitz.yml` file used to describe your website. None of the parameters described below are necessary, and Blitz will use default values if some parameter isn't explicitly defined. You'll see something like that in your command line:

```bash
[Blitz WARN] `blitz_version` is not defined: Using current Blitz version (`0.1.5`)
[Blitz WARN] `site_url` is not defined: Using an empty string (``)
```

Additionally, Blitz will validate your `blitz.yml` before building the site, notifying you about all of the obvious errors. This is an experimental feature, so I cannot guarantee that all issues with the logic in the config will be identified.

Note that at the top of every config there is a parameter called `blitz_version`. It is not necessary but I recommend keeping it in the config because Blitz can use it to warn you about major changes that have been introduced since the project was generated.

#### Site information

##### `site_url`

The host name for the site, which is an empty string by default. Given your website uses absolute URLs (more about it below), the string specified in `site_url` will be added to all URLs generated by Blitz. For example, if `site_url` will be an empty string, default index URL could be `/index.html`. Then, if you'd set `site_url` to, say, `https://getblitz.io`, default index URL would become `https://getblitz.io/index.html`.

---

##### `site_root`

Subdirectory in which the site source is located, empty string by default. Useful if your site is not located in the root directory of your web server. Imagine your website can be accessed using `https://getblitz.io/sub-domain/`, then you would set `site_url` to `https://getblitz.io` and `site_root` to `sub-domain`.

#### URL generation

##### `absolute_urls`

Specifies whether to use absolute or relative URLs, `false` by default (relative URLs). If you set this to `true`, Blitz will generate absolute URLs that will include `site_url` and `site_root` which will look like `https://getblitz.io/docs/` or `/hello/world/`. If you set it to `false`, then all URLs will be relative resulting in something like `./world/` or `../../../home/`. Using relative URls is useful when you want to avoid using a web server or simply want to make your website independent of its root.

---

##### `explicit_html_extensions`

Determines whether to use `.html` extensions in URLs or use directory names and expect the web server to server `index.html` from that directory automatically, set to `true` by default. Explicit `.html` extensions are useful if you want to browse the website offline, i.e. on your file system. If you want to make your URLs prettier you can disable them, but that will require a proper web server to serve the files.

#### Globals and pages

##### `globals`

Global values that will be passed as locals into every single Pug template used to generate the website, set to an empty object by default. This parameter can take absolutely any value as long as its an object. Consider this example usage:

```yaml
# In the config:
globals:
  site_name: 'My Site'
  site_description: 'My personal blog where I write about my projects and ideas.'
```

Now that the globals are set, you can use them anywhere in your Pug templates:

```jade
// In your Pug template:
head
    title= site_name
    meta(name='description', content=site_description)
    
```

Keep in mind that everything works as long as its valid YAML.

---

##### `pages`

Pages that describe how your site should be built from content files and templates, set to an empty array by default. There are 4 core elements that make up the site. 

* **Root pages**.
* **Child pages**.
* **Child directories**.
* **Menus**.

> The `pages` section is not yet completed

### Example `blitz.yml`

Below you can see the `blitz.yml` bundled with v0.1.4. Building a website using this config will generate no pages whatsoever.

# set this to an empty string, ''.
# This parameter is passed to every Pug page as `site_url`.
site_url: 'http://localhost'

# Site root without a trailing slash. E.g. if the root of your

# This parameter is passed to every Pug page as `site_root`.

# Whether to use absolute URLs (`http://test.org/hello/`) or

# offline, on your computer.
absolute_urls: false

# Whether to use directories and expect a server to serve
# `index.html` (`http://test.org/hello/world/`) or add explicit
# HTML extension (`http://test.org/hello/world.html`). Enable this

explicit_html_extensions: true

# Optional global parameters that will be passed to every page
# on the website. Useful for things like copyright or ads. Can
# be anything as long as it's valid YAML.
globals:

# Pages of the website. All non-root pages must have the name
# specified. For more information check the links in the beginning
