##### Features

v0.1 was the first stable release of Blitz and it introduced a lot of key features.

* YAML configuration file. `blitz.yml` is the core configuration file for Blitz. It uses YAML syntax 
* Pug (formerly Jade) templates support. As of version v0.1.1, Pug is the only templating engine supported by Blitz. The templates can use all of the Pug features as long as the result is valid Pug markup.
* Markdown and YAML support for content creation. Blitz's content files have the `.md` extension but they are not your usual Markdown files. Read [Writing content] for more information about them.
