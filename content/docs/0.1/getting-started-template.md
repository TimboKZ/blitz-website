## Getting started from a template

##### Choosing your template

Using a template is probably the fastest way to get started with Blitz. Templates provide useful boilerplates to speed up your development project. Additionally, you can study these templates to understand what Blitz is capable of and how you can achieve certain this.

The following templates are bundled with v0.1:

* `minimal`: As the name implies, this is a minimal configuration of Blitz.

##### Initialising a project

First you, have to switch to the directory you want to initialise Blitz in. For the sake of this example, we will create a directory called `blitz-example` and initialise a new project inside it[[]]:

```bash
mkdir blitz-example
cd blitz-example
blitz init -t minimal
```

Replace `minimal` with the name of your desired template from the list above and you're good to go!
